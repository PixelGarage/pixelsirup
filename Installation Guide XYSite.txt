Clone Site from GitHub
======================
From a website project only the files in the sites-folder are put under version control (no core files).
Additionally all user files like the folder sites/default/files and the settings.php file (contains credentials) are excluded.

To create a runnable project from a GitHub clone do the following:

Clone GitHub repository:
1) Go to directory ~/Sites. This is the document root of the MAMP Apache server.
2) Extract the newest Drupal Core version to a directory and name it with the project name (e.g. myNewProject).
3) Delete the sites folder.
4) Open PHPStorm. In the dialog under QuickStart choose VCS: Checkout from version control.
5) The 'Clone Repository' dialog opens.
    Choose the repository to be cloned in the dropdown menu.
    Set the parent directory to the newly created project folder (the cloned sites folder will be placed inside this folder)
    Choose always 'sites' for the directory name.
    --> the sites folder is cloned to the new project folder and is connected with the GitHub version for Pull/Push operations.
6) Create an empty folder 'files' in the directory ~/Sites/projectFolder/sites/default

Install the local Database:
1) Create a new DB in local phpMyAdmin with a unique name pixelgar_dp[ProjectName] (use this pattern)
2) Import DB-Backup found in folder sites/default/files_private/backup_migrate/manual/db_xy_stage….mysql.gz into new DB (see phpMyAdmin).
3) Copy the settings.php file from the xySite project into folder ~/Sites/xySite/sites/default (find file in same folder in xySite project)
4) Replace the db name in this file with the project db name (see above).

Start website in browser:
1) Set the document root of MAMP (in Preferences->WeServer) to the new directory, e.g. ~/Sites/projectFolder (important, otherwise site navigation fails)
2) Enter 'localhost' in browser. The project site opens.
3) Login to project site:
User:       dpAdmin
Passwort:	usual

Start implementing in PHPStorm....
Regularly commit your changes and push them to GitHub.



Installation of new local Drupal Site
=====================================

Local File structure:
1) Go to directory ~/Sites. This is the document root of the MAMP Apache server.
2) Extract the newest Drupal Core version to a directory and name it with the project name (e.g. myNewProject).
3) Copy sites-folder of the xySite-Project to the Drupal directory (replacing the sites-Folder of Drupal)
4) IMPORTANT!!!!
    Delete .git folder in the copied sites-folder to avoid a synchronisation with the xySite
    (the .git-folder is hidden, show it by entering 'showFiles' in Terminal Application)

Install the local Database:
1) Create a new DB in local phpMyAdmin with a unique name pixelgar_dp[ProjectName] (use this pattern)
2) Import DB-Backup found in folder sites/default/files_private/backup_migrate/manual/db_xy_stage….mysql.gz into new DB (see phpMyAdmin).
3) Replace db-name in settings.php with the new one. User is always pixelgar_dpUser (has all rights).

Start website in browser:

2) Enter 'localhost' in browser. The new site opens.
3) Login to new site:
User:       dpAdmin
